# PcaParser
Simple .pcap format file parser

### Description  
Simple tool I made to filter dst/src IPs taken from .pcap format files (e.g. Wireshark output files).
There is also mode to display IPs with their packet length. For more info type 'py pcap_filter.py --h'.  
Feel free to contibute and add more filters :)
